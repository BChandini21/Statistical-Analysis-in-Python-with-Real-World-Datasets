Summary of Findings:

In this analysis of the Breast Cancer dataset, we explored how features like 'mean radius' relate to tumor classification (benign or malignant). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the process and tools used:

1. Data Management:

Pandas: Loaded and managed the dataset, allowing us to compute basic statistics such as mean and median.

2. Statistical Analysis:

SciPy and Statsmodels: Conducted hypothesis testing and calculated confidence intervals to evaluate the significance of relationships between features and tumor classification.

3. Linear Regression: Analyzed the impact of 'mean radius' on tumor classification using linear regression. This analysis provided coefficients, p-values, and R-squared values to measure the strength and direction of the relationship.

4. Visualization:

Matplotlib and Seaborn: Created scatter plots and other visualizations to illustrate relationships between variables and evaluate model performance.

Key Insights:

Feature Impact: We gained insights into how 'mean radius' and potentially other features influence whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

Model Evaluation: Visualizations and statistical measures helped assess the effectiveness and accuracy of our predictive model.

Overall, this analysis provided valuable understanding of the relationships in the dataset and how specific features affect tumor classification.
